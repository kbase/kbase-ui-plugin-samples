# `samples` KBase UI Plugin

> A kbase-ui plugin providing a viewer for samples

Similar to other viewer plugins (dataview, typeview), this plugin provides a ui endpoint for viewing and exploring
samples.

## Usage

As a kbase-ui plugin, the sample landing page is invoked with a base of `https://ENV.kbase.us`, where `ENV` is the
deployment environment such as `narrative` for production, and a path formed by the url fragment, commonly know as the _
hash_ due to the usage of the `#` character to prefix it, the base of which is `#samples`

## Install

This plugin is a dependency of [kbase-ui](https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui).

## Background

This plugin exists to provide an endpoint for inspecting a taxonomic reference.

## API

### General URL

The general form is:

```url
https://ENV.kbase.us#samples/view/ID[/VERSION]
```

where:

- `ENV` is the KBase deployment environment, `narrative`, `next`, `ci`, and others.
    - `samples` is the dispatch name for the samples plugin
- `view` indicates we want the sample viewer
- `ID` is the sample id; the sample id is generated by KBase when the sample is imported into the system
- `VERSION` is an optional version; it is an integer. When a sample is updated, it is assigned a new version. Omitting
  the version references the most recent version.

### URL Examples

The sample landing page is meant to be linked to from other apps which expose the sample for viewing.

#### Some Sample

```url
https://ci.kbase.us#samples#samples/view/bfe37f5b-2e3d-4d2c-84f4-7698fecb5352/1
```

## Developing

The samples plugin is a standard create-react-app standalone web app, wrapped in components which allow integration into
kbase-ui as a plugin.

The kbase-ui integration provides configuration and authentication.

When developing locally, this wrapper provides a development copy of the kbase-ui configuration, and a ui for adding a
KBase authentication token.
